# Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements.
# Sets are unordered => Element’s order doesn’t matter
# Sets are unindexed => Cannot access elements by index
# There is no way to change items in sets.
# Sets cannot contain duplicate values.

e = set()  # Empty set dont use e = {} this is empty dict
